# Code Style Guidelines

These guidelines provide a set of rules and best practices for writing consistent and maintainable code in the Ecosystem project.

## General Guidelines

- Write clear, concise, and self-explanatory code.
- Avoid unnecessary complexity and over-engineering.
- Use meaningful variable and function names.
- Comment your code where necessary, especially for complex logic.
- Keep functions and methods short and focused. A function should do one thing and do it well.

## JavaScript/Node.js Guidelines

### Formatting

- Use 4 spaces for indentation.
- Use semicolons at the end of statements.
- Use single quotes for strings, even if escape sequences happen to be used.
- Place opening braces on the same line as the block's declaration.
- Place closing braces on a new line.

### Naming Conventions

- Use camelCase for variable and function names.
- Use PascalCase for class names.
- Use UPPERCASE for constants (constant values).

### Best Practices

- NEVER USE `var`!
- Avoid global variables.
- Prefer `const` and `let`.
- Use `===` and `!==` for comparisons.
- Use arrow functions where appropriate.
- Handle errors gracefully using try/catch or Promises.
- If a JavaScript file gets too long, consider modularizing!

### Example

```javascript
// Bad
var name = 'John';
function getName() {
    return name;
}

// Good
const name = 'John'; || let name = 'John';
const getName = () => name;
```
